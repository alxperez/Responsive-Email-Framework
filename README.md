## Overview ##
This is a responsive CSS framework for emails ~ 640px wide with 16 grids.

## Instructions ##

Code the email using tables and apply the grid classes to the "td" tags the same as you would with the [960 Grid System](http://960.gs/). After the email is coded, temporarily remove the GLOBAL CSS styling. Run the remaining code through this  [CSS Inline Tool](http://beaker.mailchimp.com/inline-css). After the CSS is made inline, add back the GLOBAL CSS styling.
